- Host Interface: Allows hosts to manage event postings and volunteer requirements which includes the ability to create, edit, and delete events.
- Volunteer Interface: Enables volunteers to browse and sign-up for events.
- Data Collector: Gathers and stores volunteer sign ups and the events postings in the database.
